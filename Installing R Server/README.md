# Install and Run R Server
## Documentation

*Objective: Install and Run R Server*

### Parameters:
1.	AMI: Amazon Linux AMI 2017.09.1 (HVM), SSD Volume Type - ami-1a962263
2.	Instance Type – t2.medium
    - RStudio recommends a minimum of 2 core / 4GB RAM for its server to support one analyst who performs testing and sandboxing.
    - Can possibly earn a few CPU credits to allow for performance burst. I do not expect it to earn lots of credits as I intend to shut it down after every use.
3.	Instance Details:
    - Network: RosettaHub VPC
    - Auto-assign Public IP – Enable
    - Create new subnet for R Server installation
    - Other settings kept as default
    - T2 Unlimited not enabled. Will observe performance before enabling

### Run R Server

### Alternative: R Studio Server AMI
I came across a R Studio Server AMI found in Community AMI. It is maintained by Louis Aslett with pre-installed R, RStudio Server, Julia and CUDA. I plan to use this AMI for future R needs to reduce set-up time and cost.
